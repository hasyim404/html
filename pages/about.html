                        On the continent of Teyvat, the people chosen by Celestia were granted a control over the power
                        of the elements in the form of Vision. In addition, each region of Teyvat has its own Archon
                        which is an entity that is considered a "God" and worshiped by the people of each region. The
                        player assumes the role of a Traveler (male named Aether, female named Lumine, depending on the
                        player's choice) who roams the world in search of his missing brother. On the way, the Traveler
                        will meet various companions with different characters and powers, he will also be guided by a
                        small fairy-like creature named Paimon. From the experience of meeting comrades and solving
                        problems in the region, the Traveler will uncover the truth behind the world he is currently
                        exploring.
